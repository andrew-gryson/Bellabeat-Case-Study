# Bellabeat-Case-Study
Bellabeat is a high-tech company that manufactures health-focused smart products that empower women with knowledge about their health and habits. They are a small, but rapidly growing company and they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market.

The main focus was to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices and apply these insights to one of Bellabeat's products. These insights will help inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy to expand its footprint in the industry.

We focused on the Bellabeat app for this analysis. The Bellabeat app provides users with health data related to their activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This data can help users better understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. The Bellabeat app connects to their line of smart wellness products so it is at the core of everything they're trying to help their consumers accomplish.
